# C-Algorithm-Club
This is a project based off the [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club). The goal of this project is to provide an
easy-to-use library of data structures, examples of algorithms, and a way for
aspiring software engineers to learn.
## To-do
### Data Structures
- Generic Stack
  - Jobs: improve explanation
  - Dynamic block implementation (95%)
    - Jobs: code review
  - Triple pointer (50%)
    - Jobs: debugging, documentation, write test, code review
    - why? Triple pointer is a flex? It's what I tried first? idk
  - Linked List Implementation (90%)
    - Jobs: documentation, code review
- Queues (15%)
