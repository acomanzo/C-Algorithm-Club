# Queues
## Generic Queues
Queues are a special type of list--like stacks--that represent actual queues
(like waiting in line to check-out at a store). Like irl, new items
are placed at the back of the queue only. The first person in the queue
is served first, and when the head of the queue is finished, everybody
behind the first moves up one spot, rinse and repeat until the queue is
empty.
## Priority Queues
Regular queues are ordered by whoever gets in line first. Now, if someone at
the grocery store slips on aisle 3 and hurts their head then that
person needs to be rushed to the front of the queue so that they can
check-out and get to the hospital. Priority queues are built on the idea that
some tasks are more urgent than others. In practice there exist
min-priority and max-priority queues where the lowest item and highest
item are at the head of the queue at all times, respectively.
