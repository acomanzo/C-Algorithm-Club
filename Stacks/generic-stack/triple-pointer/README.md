# Triple Pointer
This is the first way I tried implementing a stack in C! I can't figure it
out yet but I'd like to! The idea was that you could access the elements
like you would an array or in the dynamic block implementation but create
new elements similar to how you would with a linked list (except you'd
realloc the stack for every one new item). Think of it as a pointer to an
array of pointers.
